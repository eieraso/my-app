## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15.3.2 application for Studio Garcia Beauty Academy - a comprehensive beauty education center and salon complex in Itaquaquecetuba. The website uses the App Router pattern with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4.

### Core Technologies

#### Framework & Build

- **Next.js 15.3.2** with App Router (`/app` directory)
- **React 19** with extensive use of client components
- **TypeScript** in strict mode with path alias `@/*`

#### Styling & UI

- **Tailwind CSS v4** with PostCSS configuration
- **shadcn/ui** components (New York style, with CVA for variants)
- **tw-animate-css** for additional animation utilities
- **Custom theme tokens** mapped to CSS variables in `globals.css`
- **cn() utility** from `lib/utils.ts` for conditional class merging

#### Animation & Graphics

- **GSAP** with React integration for complex animations
  - Menu animations with timeline control
  - Text animations with character splitting
  - Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- **Split-type** for text splitting and animation
- **OGL** for WebGL shader-based backgrounds
  - Custom vertex and fragment shaders
  - Mouse interaction support
  - Hex to vec4 color conversion

### Component Architecture

#### Key Patterns

- **Client-First Components**: Heavy use of 'use client' directive for interactivity
- **Composition Pattern**: Components use composition (e.g., Button with asChild prop)
- **Animation Integration**: Most components include GSAP or OGL animations
- **Responsive Design**: Custom breakpoint handling, especially in Menu component
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with proper interface definitions

#### Component Structure

- `/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components with CVA variants
- `/components/menu/` - Navigation with GSAP animations and responsive behavior
- `/components/` - Feature components (AnimatedText, DynamicBackground, balatro)

### Animation Implementation Details

#### GSAP Usage

- Timeline-based animations with proper pause/play control
- Cleanup patterns: Always kill timelines on unmount
- Mouse interaction handling with normalized coordinates
- Stagger effects for sequential animations

#### OGL/WebGL Implementation

- Renderer setup with proper resize handling
- Uniform-based shader parameters for real-time control
- Performance optimizations with pixelFilter parameter
- WebGL context cleanup on component unmount

### Styling Conventions

- Utility-first approach with Tailwind classes
- Responsive utilities throughout (`lg:` breakpoint = 1024px)
- Dark mode support via `.dark` class variants
- oklch color space for modern color management
- Consistent spacing and typography scales

### Important Configuration

- **components.json** - shadcn/ui configuration with gray base color
- **ESLint** with Next.js Core Web Vitals and Prettier integration
- **Prettier** with Tailwind CSS plugin for class sorting
- Images from `via.placeholder.com` allowed in Next.js config
